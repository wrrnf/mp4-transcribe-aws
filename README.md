3. Create a local clone of this repository (or just download the script)

## How to use this script
1. Run `./mp4-transcribe.sh -i <video_file_name> -b <bucket_name>`, where `video_file_name` is your source video file and `<bucket_name>` is the name of the bucket you created above.
2. Open the AWS console to see the current progress of the transcription.
